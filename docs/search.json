    "section": "",
    "text": "The DISEASE OUTBREAKS DATA project arose from the need for open, reliable information on pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks, offering broad coverage of diseases, time periods, and geography, and ensuring statistical soundness for research purposes.\nThe dataset is the result of a collaborative effort by a team of researchers from the University of Göttingen, the University of Groningen, and the University of Bordeaux. The project was made possible through financial support from the ENLIGHT network, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany.\nIn the first version of the dataset, a total of 2227 outbreaks of 70 different infectious diseases were found, occurring in a total of 233 countries and territories from January 1996 until March 2022. These findings are published in Springer Nature’s Scientific Data. Read the paper by clicking here! Additionally, the data, metadata, and the code to replicate the first version of this dataset are publicly available on Figshare. You can download them by clicking here!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit of analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit of analysis in the database is an outbreak, defined as the occurrence of at least one case of a specific disease in a country -or territory- during a particular year. Therefore, a country -or territory- cannot have more than one outbreak of the same disease in the same year, although it may experience outbreaks of different diseases within the same year. A country can only have multiple outbreaks of the same disease if they occur in different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime & geographic data coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last version of the dataset contains information on 3050 outbreaks:  Temporal coverage: 01/01/1996 - 30/09/2024  Geographic coverage: 236  Number of diseases included: 85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of questions, requests, or collaborations, you can contact Dr. Juan Armando Torres Munguia via GitHub, X, or here.\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\nSource\nThe sources for the disease outbreaks data project are the Disease Outbreak News (DONs) and the Coronavirus Dashboard produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). This information is issued under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Intergovernmental Organization (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO) license, which allows users to freely copy, reproduce, reprint, distribute, translate, and adapt WHO materials for non-commercial purposes.\nThe information from the DONs includes all reports on confirmed acute public health events or potential events of concern that have occurred since 1996. Specifically, DONs include events of:\n\nUnknown cause but with significant or potential health concern that may affect international travel or trade.\nKnown cause with demonstrated ability to produce a serious public health impact and spread internationally.\nHigh public concern that could potentially disrupt required public health interventions or international travel and trade.\n\nThe Coronavirus Dashboard presents information reported by official public health authorities from countries and territories worldwide.\n\n\n\nData collection and integration processes\nThe following figure provides a schematic overview of the data collection and integration processes used in the disease outbreaks data project.\n\n\nSchematic Overview of Data Collection and Integration Processes\n\n\n\n(A) Data collection and database of the DONs; (B) Data collection and database of the Coronavirus Dashboard; (C) Geo-spatial information.  Fuente: Torres Munguía, Badarau, Díaz Pavez, Martínez-Zarzoso & Wacker. A global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks. Sci Data 9, 683 (2022).  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01797-2\n\n\nIn stage (A), DONs are collected from the WHO website. This process was automated using an R script to extract the information from the DONs. The earliest DON records a cholera outbreak reported on 22 January 1996 in Cabo Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Senegal.\nTo ensure standardized concepts and definitions, official short country names in English, according to ISO-3166-23 and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision, are used.\nThree recording issues need to be tackled at stage (A):\n\nSome DONs report multiple diseases.\nSome DONs report disease outbreaks occurring in more than one country.\nSome DONs register the same outbreak multiple times due to situation updates.\n\nTo resolve these issues at stage (A):\n\nFor DONs reporting more than one disease (for instance, DON0065 on influenza and malaria in Ghana, or DON1094 on chikungunya and dengue in the southwest Indian Ocean) and/or reporting more than one country (e.g., DON1540 about an outbreak of polio in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DON0617 on a meningococcal disease outbreak in the Great Lakes area) the DON is replicated for each diseases (or country). For instance, DON0617 informs of an outbreak that occurred in Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania (Great Lakes area). Therefore, this DON was registered three times, one for each country.\nTo avoid multiplicity issues, we deleted all DONs that reported the same disease in the same country more than once in a calendar year. Variants or mutations of viruses, such as avian influenza A(H1N1), A(H1N2), A(H5N1), A(H3N2), etc., were considered the same disease, i.e., influenza due to identified zoonotic or pandemic influenza virus. This ensured only one observation per disease, country, and year.\n\nIn stage (B), given that outbreaks related to COVID-19 are not included in the DONs, this information is extracted from the Coronavirus Dashboard. Specifically, we dichotomized the data on cases per country per year, assigning a value of one if a country had at least one reported case of Coronavirus, and zero otherwise. For standardization, we followed the same approach as in stage (A), using the official short country names in English according to ISO-3166-23 and ICD-10-31.\nIn stage (C), the geographic information from the World Administrative Boundaries - Countries and Territories dataset by Société OPENDATASOFT (available at this link) is merged with the resulting data from stages (A) and (B)."

Therefore, a country -or territory- cannot have more than one outbreak of the same disease in the same year, although it may experience outbreaks of different diseases within the same year. A country can only have multiple outbreaks of the same disease if they occur in different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the disease outbreaks maps?\n\n\n\n\n\nUse your mouse to zoom in and out by scrolling, or click the + and − buttons on the top right of the map. To pan across the map, click and hold your mouse while moving it in the desired direction. Hover over any country to see the specific information that will be displayed in a pop-up label. The map is color-coded based on the frequency of outbreaks in each country. Darker shades indicate a higher number of outbreaks, while lighter shades represent fewer outbreaks. The legend on the bottom left shows the number of outbreaks corresponding to each color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage notes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maps presented here demonstrate the potential use of disease outbreaks data for the research community. The first map filters the data by years, while the second highlights an example of filtering by both region and specific disease.  By visualizing the geographic distribution of disease outbreaks, these maps allow policymakers to identify the countries most vulnerable to outbreaks and assess their preparedness. This can inform the development of strategies and policies aimed at mitigating the spread of future outbreaks, considering regional susceptibility and resilience.  Further research using this database can integrate these findings with other sources to explore the factors driving countries’ exposure to pandemic- and epidemic-prone diseases, potentially improving response efforts in the future.\n\n\n\n\nA map of the outbreaks occurred from 2000 to 2023 associated with all the diseases\nThis map illustrates the global distribution of disease outbreaks that occurred between 2000 and 2023, encompassing all reported diseases. It provides a comprehensive overview of the regions most affected by outbreaks over the last two decades, allowing for an intuitive comparison of disease impact across different countries and regions.  Notably, there is a higher concentration of disease outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa. As discussed in Torres Munguía, Badarau, Díaz Pavez, Martínez-Zarzoso & Wacker (2022), the infectious diseases primarily driving this pattern include cholera, acute poliomyelitis, meningococcal meningitis, and yellow fever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA map of the outbreaks occurred in Africa from 1996 to 2023 associated with arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers\nThis map presents the distribution of disease outbreaks across Africa between 1996 and 2023 related to arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers. Arthropod-borne viral fevers (also known as arboviral diseases) are infections caused by viruses transmitted through bites from infected arthropods, such as mosquitoes and ticks. On the other hand, viral haemorrhagic fevers are spread primarily through the interaction of infected rodents and humans. Both of these groups of diseases are highly prone to epidemics and are classified under “A90-A99” in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).  This map highlights the occurrence of arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Chikungunya, Dengue, Yellow Fever, Zika Virus, Oropouche Virus, Lassa Fever, Ebola, and Marburg Virus Disease, among others. Many of these diseases are endemic in parts of Africa, leading to recurring outbreaks that pose significant public health challenges. By visualizing the outbreaks of these diseases, this map provides insights into the geographic spread and intensity of these epidemics, allowing for a clearer understanding of regions most affected by arboviral and haemorrhagic fevers over time.",
